## **About Me**

**Barahebuza Murengera Aime Lucky** is a master's student in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology department at the University of Connecticut. The purpose of my research will be to examine how the loss of megafauna in the tropics due to hunting affects natural regeneration patterns of tropical forests from individual species to the ecosystems as a whole.
